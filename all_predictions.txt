relaunched itself as Mukashi malware and has been actively exploiting Zyxel
network-attached storage (NAS) devices’ vulnerability reported under
CVE-2020-9054.
LABEL: Port | VALUE: 9054

-------------------25--------------------
TEXT: As soon as the proof-of-concept (PoC) for CVE-2020-9054 was made publicly
available last month, this vulnerability was promptly abused to infect
vulnerable versions of Zyxel network-attached storage (NAS) devices with a new
Mirai variant – Mukashi.

CVE-2017-7577 have already been exploited by the Mirai botnet.
LABEL: Port | VALUE: 7577

-------------------28--------------------
TEXT: On 12 December 2017 researchers identified a variant of Mirai exploiting a zero-
day flaw in Huawei HG532 routers to accelerate Mirai botnets infection,
implementing two known SOAP related exploits on routers web interface,
CVE-2014–8361 and CVE-2017–17215.

-------------------30--------------------
TEXT: The exploit to be used depends on the specific port the bot was able to connect
to. Specifically, port 8080 brings an exploit for a flaw in Netgear DGN1000 and
DGN2200 v1 routers (also used by the Reaper botnet).
LABEL: Model | VALUE: Netgear DGN1000
LABEL: Model | VALUE: DGN2200 v1 routers

-------------------31--------------------
TEXT: The used exploit depends on the specific port that the connection was

router exploits (also used by Reaper botnet).
LABEL: Model | VALUE: Netgear DGN1000
LABEL: Model | VALUE: DGN2200 v1 router

-------------------32--------------------
TEXT: While the original version of Mirai used brute force techniques to compromise
devices, Wicked relies on known exploits — used depending on the port the bot is
connected to. If connected to Port 8080, the malware will use a remote code
execution (RCE) Netgear exploit which works on DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 routers,
and is the same tool used by the Reaper botnet to compromise target machines.

download the malicious payload by writing exploit strings to the socket.
Different exploits are used depending on the port where the connection was
established. On port 8080, Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200 v1 router exploits are
used, a CCTV-DVR remote code execution exploit is used on port 81,
